100:16:49,294 --> 00:16:25,549
<i>This is not the most inspiringchoice for vice president, right?</i>200:16:24,970 --> 00:16:07,017
<i>A well-respected operator,</i><i>pragmatic, but let's face it,</i>300:16:06,438 --> 00:15:51,380
<i>this is probably just a nodto Congress, tapping one of their own.</i>400:15:50,222 --> 00:15:27,057
<i>It's really nothing more thana placeholder until 2016, assuredly.</i>500:15:23,582 --> 00:15:12,000
<i>I'm not surprised he's doing</i><i>a private swearing-in.</i>600:15:12,000 --> 00:14:55,205
<i>My bet is the president wants to drawas little attention to this as possible.</i>700:14:54,626 --> 00:14:39,568
<i>There's just</i><i>no real wow factor...</i>800:14:03,083 --> 00:13:52,079
Christina's working out well?900:13:52,079 --> 00:13:38,180
She's getting her sea legs, butI've been happy so far.1000:13:37,601 --> 00:13:26,018
- She works hard.- It's a big load off my shoulders1100:13:24,860 --> 00:13:11,540
when she can travel with thepresident instead of me.1200:13:11,540 --> 00:12:54,745
I get so much more donewhen I stay here.1300:12:43,742 --> 00:12:31,580
President have a preferencein the whip's race?1400:12:31,580 --> 00:12:21,155
I can't believe how uglyit's gotten.1500:12:20,576 --> 00:12:10,731
He was more disappointedthan anything else...1600:12:10,731 --> 00:11:55,094
- Watch out, Wes.- I hope I'm not interrupting.1700:11:53,936 --> 00:11:42,933
- Not at all.- This is something else.1800:11:42,354 --> 00:11:30,771
Security specs. They hadto work fast. Watch yourself.1900:11:30,771 --> 00:11:20,926
It's like a war zonearound here.2000:11:20,347 --> 00:11:08,185
The idea is to keepthe war from getting in.2100:11:07,026 --> 00:10:56,023
How's the whip's race coming,Congressman?2200:10:56,023 --> 00:10:47,915
It's tight betweenyou and Howard?2300:10:47,336 --> 00:10:39,228
Well, you'd have to ask Howard,2400:10:39,228 --> 00:10:27,066
if he's not too busytrying to sodomize me.2500:10:26,487 --> 00:10:09,692
- Should we go say hello? - For God sakes,don't make me talk to that man.2600:09:56,372 --> 00:09:31,470
- Good to see you, Howard.- Nice to see you, Wes.2700:09:30,311 --> 00:09:13,517
Yeah, I bet it is.2800:08:00,546 --> 00:07:50,701
- Bob.- Frank.2900:07:50,121 --> 00:07:40,855
- Thanks for inviting me, Frank.- What?3000:07:40,276 --> 00:07:29,852
- Thanks for inviting me.- You bet.3100:07:29,852 --> 00:06:59,737
- Hey, Frank.- Judge! Good to see you.3200:06:58,000 --> 00:06:41,784
- Is there somewhere I can go to change?- Yes, absolutely.3300:06:41,205 --> 00:06:26,147
There's room down the hall.Doug, will you take care of the judge?3400:06:25,568 --> 00:06:13,985
And when he's ready,let's get this thing over with.3500:06:13,406 --> 00:06:04,140
I'll start bringing 'em in.3600:06:03,561 --> 00:05:52,558
"That I take thisobligation freely,3700:05:52,558 --> 00:05:32,867
without any mental reservationor purpose of evasion..."3800:05:31,709 --> 00:05:21,864
That I takethis obligation freely,3900:05:21,284 --> 00:05:08,543
without any mental reservationor purpose of evasion...4000:05:08,543 --> 00:04:59,856
"...and that I will..."4100:04:59,277 --> 00:04:50,011
One heartbeat awayfrom the presidency,4200:04:50,011 --> 00:04:37,270
and not a singlevote cast in my name.4300:04:36,112 --> 00:04:14,684
- Democracy is so overrated.- "...on which I am about to enter,4400:04:14,105 --> 00:03:57,310
- so help me God."- ...and that I will well and faithfully4500:03:56,731 --> 00:03:27,195
discharge the duties of the office onwhich I am about to enter, so help me God.4600:03:25,458 --> 00:03:02,872
- Congratulations,Mr. Vice President.4700:01:58,588 --> 00:01:42,951
All right, let's get backto running the country.4800:01:41,793 --> 00:01:24,419
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font><font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>4900:-7:-27,-802 --> 00:-7:-41,-123
Now, one of you isgonna replace me as the whip.5000:-7:-41,-702 --> 00:-7:-54,-443
You're the two frontrunnersand we know you both want it.5100:-7:-55,-22 --> 00:-8:-7,-763
You're not behavinglike men who belong in the leadership.5200:-8:-7,-763 --> 00:-8:-21,-662
We need to tonedown the rhetoric.5300:-8:-22,-820 --> 00:-8:-35,-561
- You're hurting the party.- I'm just responding5400:-8:-36,-140 --> 00:-8:-44,-827
to the lies Howard'sbeen slinging.5500:-8:-44,-827 --> 00:-8:-57,-568
Those junkets happened, Wes.I'm not making it up.5600:-8:-58,-147 --> 00:-9:-11,-467
- And nepotism's any better?- That's just not true and you know it.5700:-9:-12,-625 --> 00:-9:-25,-945
Your sister's husband happenedto be appointed state treasurer?5800:-9:-25,-945 --> 00:-9:-34,-632
Ex-husband. And yes.5900:-9:-35,-212 --> 00:-9:-45,-57
That is sucha load of crap, Howard.6000:-9:-45,-57 --> 00:-9:-56,-60
Gentlemen, Bob is right.6100:-9:-57,-219 --> 00:-10:-8,-801
This sort of catfightinggets out in the press,6200:-10:-8,-801 --> 00:-10:-24,-438
whichever one of you winshits the ground limping.6300:-10:-25,-17 --> 00:-10:-55,-711
Let's keep it clean and bring some civilityback to the House. Can we agree to that?6400:-11:-14,-822 --> 00:-11:-25,-826
I'd feel a lot betterif you shook hands on it.6500:-12:-4,-49 --> 00:-12:-15,-631
Thank you.6600:-12:-55,-592 --> 00:-13:-8,-333
I'm with him right now,Christina.6700:-13:-8,-911 --> 00:-13:-21,-73
I'm off. I'll swingby your office later.6800:-13:-21,-652 --> 00:-13:-36,-131
Don't. It's not ready yet.I'll be working from here.6900:-13:-36,-710 --> 00:-13:-49,-451
- What?- Tusk is in town.7000:-13:-49,-451 --> 00:-14:-2,-771
He's meeting with the presidentin 45 minutes. Christina just told me.7100:-14:-3,-929 --> 00:-14:-17,-249
- The Joint Commission talks.- That's what she said.7200:-14:-17,-828 --> 00:-14:-31,-148
- Christina's proving useful.- We'll stay in touch.7300:-14:-31,-148 --> 00:-14:-45,-627
Get me Cathy Durant.Your people coming by?7400:-14:-46,-785 --> 00:-15:-6,-475
Just my new chief of staff.That's all I've got until we hire more.7500:-15:-7,-55 --> 00:-15:-26,-745
So how's it feel to be marriedto the vice president?7600:-15:-27,-324 --> 00:-15:-48,-173
Exactlythe same... just louder.7700:-15:-49,-331 --> 00:-16:-2,-72
Secretary Durant.7800:-16:-2,-651 --> 00:-16:-9,-22
Cathy.7900:-16:-25,-817 --> 00:-16:-35,-83
Raymond.8000:-16:-45,-507 --> 00:-16:-58,-827
Congratulations,Mr. Vice President.8100:-16:-59,-406 --> 00:-17:-24,-309
Thank you very much.May I please introduce Secretary Durant.8200:-17:-25,-467 --> 00:-17:-45,-737
- A pleasure, Madame Secretary.- Hi.8300:-17:-46,-316 --> 00:-18:-12,-956
Well, this is quite a surprise.I had no idea you were in town.8400:-18:-14,-693 --> 00:-18:-28,-14
Ah...8500:-18:-28,-593 --> 00:-18:-37,-859
Well...8600:-20:-7,-45 --> 00:-20:-19,-207
Morning, sir.8700:-20:-19,-786 --> 00:-20:-31,-948
- Mr. President.- Catherine.8800:-20:-33,-685 --> 00:-20:-52,-796
- We just happened to run into Raymond.- Huh!8900:-20:-53,-376 --> 00:-21:-11,-329
Wonderful. Come on in.9000:-21:-26,-386 --> 00:-21:-39,-127
The phone records willabsolutely prove I'm right.9100:-21:-39,-706 --> 00:-21:-48,-973
There were no phone records.You know that.9200:-21:-48,-973 --> 00:-21:-59,-397
The data history,with the carrier.9300:-22:00,-555 --> 00:-22:-12,-138
Even if we got the case reopened,which isn't gonna happen,9400:-22:-12,-717 --> 00:-22:-30,-670
you have any idea how hard itis to get a warrant for phone data?9500:-22:-30,-670 --> 00:-22:-45,-727
Probable cause.Bring him in for questioning.9600:-22:-46,-307 --> 00:-23:-1,-364
- Technically, you have jurisdiction.- The vice president?9700:-23:-3,-101 --> 00:-23:-19,-896
I know this all sounds preposterousto you, but if you go through my notes...9800:-23:-20,-475 --> 00:-23:-39,-587
- We've been through your notes.- You've listened, but you haven't heard me.9900:-23:-40,-745 --> 00:-23:-56,-382
Circumstantial,yes, but plausible.10000:-23:-56,-961 --> 00:-24:-14,-914
I know you'vereopened cases on less.10100:-24:-15,-493 --> 00:-24:-35,-183
This has gotta stop, man.We keep having the same conversation.10200:-24:-36,-342 --> 00:-24:-48,-504
It can't be an accident.10300:-25:-5,-878 --> 00:-25:-26,-726
OK, I'm gonnashow you something.10400:-25:-38,-309 --> 00:-26:-6,-107
CNN tried to get ahold of this,we 86'd it out of respect to the family.10500:-26:-7,-845 --> 00:-26:-18,-269
The footage?10600:-26:-40,-276 --> 00:-26:-59,-967
- It's not easy to watch.- I want to see it.10700:-27:-27,-765 --> 00:-27:-49,-193
She tripped, or jumped.10800:-28:-3,-671 --> 00:-28:-15,-254
She didn't jump.10900:-28:-41,-315 --> 00:-28:-52,-897
Here it is, frame by frame.11000:-30:-20,-926 --> 00:-30:-45,-249
Now, there were two witnesses.One was a 70-year-old womanwith macular degeneration.11100:-30:-45,-828 --> 00:-31:00,-886
All she saw was a blur.The second was the conductor of the train.11200:-31:-2,-44 --> 00:-31:-18,-839
He said it looked like she fell.Between those two and this video,11300:-31:-19,-418 --> 00:-31:-35,-55
that's all there is.11400:-31:-35,-634 --> 00:-32:-11,-540
You can watch it a milliontimes, but this case is closed.11500:-32:-13,-856 --> 00:-32:-32,-389
We should limit the agendato a couple of key issues:11600:-32:-33,-547 --> 00:-32:-52,-79
import tariffs on industrialmanufactured goods,11700:-32:-53,-237 --> 00:-33:-10,-611
and export quotason rare earth elements.11800:-33:-10,-611 --> 00:-33:-25,-90
They're using bothas political levers.11900:-33:-26,-248 --> 00:-33:-43,-43
I agree these are two areas where we canmake meaningful progress.12000:-33:-43,-622 --> 00:-33:-59,-259
But I'm worried about the risein corporate cyberattacks.12100:-34:00,-417 --> 00:-34:-26,-478
- That's a rabbit hole.- We have to address it sooner or later.12200:-34:-27,-636 --> 00:-34:-40,-956
It's just a matter of whetherwe want to address it now.12300:-34:-41,-535 --> 00:-35:-9,-913
Chinese don't like surprises.All I'm proposing is that weuse the Joint Commission talks12400:-35:-11,-650 --> 00:-35:-27,-866
to bring it up gently now,set the stage for the next round.12500:-35:-28,-445 --> 00:-35:-38,-870
Look, I'm a businessman,not a diplomat.12600:-35:-39,-448 --> 00:-36:-3,-772
But I'm a businessman with35 years' experience working in China.12700:-36:-4,-930 --> 00:-36:-17,-671
When they come to the table,you don't get greedy.12800:-36:-18,-250 --> 00:-36:-33,-887
You're working on a co-venturerefinery project in Fujian.12900:-36:-35,-625 --> 00:-36:-46,-627
Which would bethe first of its kind.13000:-36:-46,-627 --> 00:-37:-3,-423
Open the gatewayfor increased investment...13100:-37:-4,-01 --> 00:-37:-19,-59
Cyberattacksthreaten those co-ventures.13200:-37:-19,-638 --> 00:-37:-39,-329
There's less a need for themif the Chinese can obtain new technology13300:-37:-40,-487 --> 00:-37:-54,-966
- from corporate espionage.- Frank, what do you think?13400:-37:-55,-544 --> 00:-38:-5,-969
I lean more towardRaymond's thinking.13500:-38:-6,-548 --> 00:-38:-23,-343
If we antagonize the Chinese,we could undo years of progress.13600:-38:-24,-501 --> 00:-38:-51,-141
Allow me to do this quietly, with asoft touch. I won't antagonize them, sir.13700:-38:-51,-721 --> 00:-39:-4,-461
The last thing we want to dois rock the boat.13800:-39:-6,-199 --> 00:-39:-14,-307
What do you havein mind, Catherine?13900:-39:-14,-886 --> 00:-39:-32,-839
A suggested agenda,not a demand.14000:-39:-33,-997 --> 00:-39:-56,-04
We'll keep it mid-level.I won't get anywhere near it.14100:-39:-57,-163 --> 00:-40:-16,-274
- Raymond?- I've voiced my concerns.14200:-40:-39,-439 --> 00:-40:-56,-813
- A very soft touch.- You have my word, sir.14300:-40:-57,-392 --> 00:-41:-6,-658
Good.14400:-41:-17,-83 --> 00:-41:-36,-194
Raymond, you wantto grab some lunch?14500:-41:-44,-302 --> 00:-41:-57,-622
- Would love to.- Thanks, Frank.14600:-41:-58,-201 --> 00:-42:-17,-892
- Welcome to the West Wing.- Thank you, sir.14700:-42:-53,-219 --> 00:-43:-12,-909
The president is like a lonetree in an empty field.14800:-43:-14,-67 --> 00:-43:-26,-809
He leans whichever waythe wind is blowing.14900:-43:-26,-809 --> 00:-43:-52,-869
And right now, Raymond Tuskblows far too strong from the West.15000:-43:-54,-607 --> 00:-44:-7,-348
- Is that a wig?- No.15100:-44:-7,-348 --> 00:-44:-25,-880
- He's been growing it out for months.- Here, this way.15200:-44:-26,-459 --> 00:-44:-40,-937
Diane says she likes it long.15300:-44:-42,-96 --> 00:-45:-13,-369
I told her she'll feel differentlyonce she sees the first dreadlock or...15400:-45:-14,-527 --> 00:-45:-26,-109
- ...smells it.- Oh!15500:-45:-40,-09 --> 00:-45:-52,-170
I went to see yourdaughter last weekend.15600:-46:-7,-228 --> 00:-46:-19,-390
- How is she?- You want to see a picture?15700:-46:-21,-127 --> 00:-46:-32,-710
OK.15800:-46:-44,-292 --> 00:-46:-58,-771
- Was her mother there?- Yeah.15900:-47:-4,-562 --> 00:-47:-13,-249
Are they OK on money?16000:-47:-13,-829 --> 00:-47:-26,-569
The rate at Greenwoodsis going up in January.16100:-47:-27,-148 --> 00:-47:-45,-102
Catalina's worriedshe's gonna be short.16200:-47:-45,-681 --> 00:-47:-59,000
I'll make sure to putmore into the account.16300:-48:00,-159 --> 00:-48:-10,-583
We don't have to talkabout her if you don't want.16400:-48:-10,-583 --> 00:-48:-30,-853
No, no, no, it's fine.I appreciate you going to see her.16500:-48:-31,-432 --> 00:-48:-46,-490
I'm sorry, Ted, I thought thatwhen you asked me to lunch,16600:-48:-47,-647 --> 00:-49:-7,-338
- it was because you...- No, no, no. I mean... yes.16700:-49:-7,-917 --> 00:-49:-34,-558
I want to make sure theyhave what they need. But no.16800:-49:-36,-295 --> 00:-49:-58,-881
The reason I wanted to talk...16900:-50:-8,-147 --> 00:-50:-26,-100
- Lorrie Tate.- Lorrie's a friend of mine.17000:-50:-27,-258 --> 00:-50:-39,-420
What about her?17100:-50:-40,000 --> 00:-50:-57,-952
She mentioned you wereinterested in the whip's race.17200:-50:-58,-532 --> 00:-51:-19,-959
Oh, no.Oh, I wish she hadn't.17300:-51:-21,-697 --> 00:-51:-44,-283
- Why not?- Because it's ridiculous.17400:-51:-44,-862 --> 00:-51:-53,-549
Is it?17500:-52:-10,-923 --> 00:-52:-22,-506
I just mentioned it offhand.17600:-52:-23,-85 --> 00:-52:-38,-722
The whole Webb and Buchwalterthing, it's just...17700:-52:-39,-300 --> 00:-52:-53,-779
- Complete mess.- But I wasn't serious.17800:-52:-55,-517 --> 00:-53:-15,-207
I think you should be serious.Do you want to do it?17900:-53:-15,-786 --> 00:-53:-28,-527
I don't have the experience,Ted. And I don't...18000:-53:-28,-527 --> 00:-53:-44,-743
- Yes or no?- Yes, of course.18100:-53:-45,-901 --> 00:-54:-7,-329
Someday. But now?I don't have the money they do.18200:-54:-8,-487 --> 00:-54:-28,-178
- Unless you use mine.- You can't waste your money on...18300:-54:-29,-335 --> 00:-54:-51,-922
If I funnel my PAC moneyto some folks who are on the fence,18400:-54:-53,-80 --> 00:-55:-10,-454
round up a couple dozencommitments before you announce,18500:-55:-11,-33 --> 00:-55:-39,-990
that would make you an instant contender.Now, tell me that's a waste.18600:-55:-41,-727 --> 00:-55:-53,-310
We're talkinghundreds of thousands.18700:-55:-53,-889 --> 00:-56:-7,-788
It's not a Christmas present,Jackie.18800:-56:-8,-946 --> 00:-56:-25,-162
With you as whip, I havea strong ally in the leadership.18900:-56:-25,-741 --> 00:-56:-57,-14
I stand to gain as much as you.Now, hang on one second.19000:-56:-58,-752 --> 00:-57:-13,-810
I don't know where the...19100:-57:-25,-971 --> 00:-57:-35,-237
<i>How did it go?</i><i>Did he buy it?</i>19200:-57:-36,-395 --> 00:-57:-54,-349
Whatever bug you put in his ear,it burrowed deep.19300:-57:-54,-928 --> 00:-58:-10,-564
It was easy. The man adoresyou like you're his own child.19400:-58:-10,-564 --> 00:-58:-25,-622
But you sure as hell bettermake me chief deputy.19500:-58:-26,-780 --> 00:-58:-51,-683
- I need to win first.- Ted and I make two, 111 to go.19600:-58:-52,-841 --> 00:-59:-8,-478
It's always good when the chief deputyknows her arithmetic.19700:-59:-8,-478 --> 00:-59:-23,-535
Fuck off.Let's start taking names.19800:-59:-24,-693 --> 00:-59:-48,-438
- This one seems promising.- Connor Ellis. He's solid.19900:-59:-49,-17 --> -1:00:-9,-287
- Good experience. - He's the one thatgot Senator Jones out of that mess200-1:00:-10,-445 --> -1:00:-29,-556
- with the push-polling.- Yes. Kept him from the Ethics Committee.201-1:00:-30,-714 --> -1:00:-50,-984
- Let's set up an interview.- I'll find a good time in the schedule.202-1:00:-52,-721 --> -1:-1:-15,-308
Let's talk about the schedule.I think we need to be...203-1:-1:-15,-887 --> -1:-1:-31,-523
...more selectivewith the events I do.204-1:-1:-32,-682 --> -1:-1:-57,-05
Some of these are leftovers fromMrs. Matthews. We cancancel whatever you like.205-1:-1:-58,-163 --> -1:-2:-9,-746
And what's this?206-1:-2:-9,-746 --> -1:-2:-28,-278
Your husband will be pinning starson two newly commissioned Marine generals.207-1:-2:-29,-437 --> -1:-2:-47,-969
- I think that's one you should do.- OK, walk me through it.208-1:-2:-48,-548 --> -1:-3:-9,-976
The generals are Alicia Hamptonand Dalton McGinnis.209-1:-3:-10,-555 --> -1:-3:-28,-508
- Arriving at 6:50...- Dalton McGinnis?210-1:-3:-29,-666 --> -1:-3:-42,-986
Yes. Do you know him?211-1:-4:-6,-731 --> -1:-4:-25,-842
We went to college together.212-1:-4:-26,-421 --> -1:-4:-43,-216
I'm sorry. Where were we?Um, arrive what time?213-1:-4:-43,-795 --> -1:-4:-54,-799
- Six-fifty.- Great. I'd like a list214-1:-4:-55,-957 --> -1:-5:-6,-960
of all the peoplethat will be attending.215-1:-5:-6,-960 --> -1:-5:-22,-597
It's not that big a dealif I get left out,216-1:-5:-23,-176 --> -1:-5:-34,-759
but you'rethe secretary of state.217-1:-5:-35,-338 --> -1:-5:-48,-658
I mean, Tusk should notbe determining policy.218-1:-5:-49,-237 --> -1:-6:-8,-349
The president alone shouldinstruct you on what you are to pursue.219-1:-6:-8,-928 --> -1:-6:-26,-881
- What's their relationship?- He's has had his ear for years.220-1:-6:-28,-39 --> -1:-6:-41,-359
- An advisor...- More of a mentor.221-1:-6:-41,-938 --> -1:-6:-54,-100
And one whose adviceis not easily dismissed.222-1:-6:-54,-679 --> -1:-7:-6,-262
He's gonna keep pushing backon cyberwarfare.223-1:-7:-6,-262 --> -1:-7:-29,-427
- Not if I get it on the agenda.- Especially if you get it on the agenda.224-1:-7:-30,-585 --> -1:-7:-41,-10
Tusk is not gonnatake any chances225-1:-7:-41,-589 --> -1:-7:-56,-646
when the next Joint Commissiontalks come around.226-1:-7:-57,-226 --> -1:-8:-6,-492
You agreed with himin the meeting.227-1:-8:-7,-71 --> -1:-8:-23,-286
If we had ganged up, he would've takena firmer position.228-1:-8:-23,-866 --> -1:-8:-45,-873
For all we know, he's convincingthe president right now to change his mind.229-1:-8:-47,-31 --> -1:-9:-7,-879
Now, we need to removethat option as a possibility.230-1:-9:-9,-38 --> -1:-9:-38,-574
- How? - Force the Chinese toconfront the issue now,231-1:-9:-40,-311 --> -1:-9:-58,-843
- this round of talks.- I promised the president a soft touch.232-1:-10:00,-01 --> -1:-10:-24,-325
- I can't intentionally break my promise.- What if it was unintentional?233-1:-10:-38,-804 --> -1:-11:-10,-77
Cathy, if you don't like howthe table is set, turn over the table.234-1:-11:-35,-559 --> -1:-11:-53,-512
- You're cheating.- No, I'm not. It's vapor.235-1:-11:-54,-91 --> -1:-12:-9,-728
- Still.- You should try it.236-1:-12:-9,-728 --> -1:-12:-39,-842
- Addiction without the consequences.- It's all yours.237-1:-12:-41,000 --> -1:-12:-52,-583
You staying up?238-1:-13:00,-691 --> -1:-13:-12,-853
This ceremony tomorrow night.239-1:-13:-14,-11 --> -1:-13:-30,-227
- You don't want to go.- If I don't have to.240-1:-13:-30,-227 --> -1:-13:-40,-651
I hate thesesort of things, too,241-1:-13:-41,-230 --> -1:-14:-2,-79
but it is my first publicappearance as vice president.242-1:-14:-14,-241 --> -1:-14:-29,-877
- OK.- Thank you.243-1:-14:-55,-359 --> -1:-15:-12,-733
Should we turn thisinto a proper office?244-1:-15:-13,-312 --> -1:-15:-40,-531
That's not a bad idea.No privacy downstairs.245-1:-15:-41,-690 --> -1:-15:-55,-10
I'll talk to the contractor.246-1:-15:-55,-589 --> -1:-16:-14,-121
- Good night, Francis.- Good night.247-1:-18:-18,-56 --> -1:-18:-38,-325
Sir, sir!<i> Congressional Record.</i>Weren't the talks supposed to go until six?248-1:-18:-39,-483 --> -1:-18:-55,-120
- We can't talk if they won't listen.- Did the Chinese walk out?249-1:-18:-55,-699 --> -1:-19:-7,-861
We made it clear that we won'tdiscuss any other issues250-1:-19:-7,-861 --> -1:-19:-22,-918
until government-sponsoredcyberattacks are on the table.251-1:-19:-24,-656 --> -1:-19:-36,-238
That's not whatthey wanted to hear.252-1:-19:-36,-818 --> -1:-19:-48,-979
Sir, what did you tell the Chinesedelegation before they walked out?253-1:-19:-49,-558 --> -1:-20:-7,-511
We didn't have anybody there.The Joint Commission'susually a snooze fest.254-1:-20:-8,-670 --> -1:-20:-21,-990
- Not today, it wasn't.- I've got Greer on it.255-1:-20:-23,-727 --> -1:-20:-34,-731
Isn't this international?256-1:-20:-35,-310 --> -1:-20:-45,-734
We need somebody from the techbeat if we want any background257-1:-20:-45,-734 --> -1:-21:-2,-529
- on cyberwarfare.- Does he have anybody on record yet?258-1:-21:-3,-687 --> -1:-21:-17,-07
The Chinese aren't talking.And all the US delegation said259-1:-21:-17,-587 --> -1:-21:-33,-802
- is what's in the AP wire.- I want something online in two hours.260-1:-21:-34,-381 --> -1:-21:-50,-597
In-depth follow-upsometime this week.261-1:-21:-59,-863 --> -1:-22:-29,-399
Hey, Lucas... you all right?262-1:-22:-29,-979 --> -1:-22:-40,-981
Yeah, why?263-1:-22:-42,-140 --> -1:-23:00,-672
You're wearing the sameclothes you wore yesterday.264-1:-23:-1,-251 --> -1:-23:-13,-414
Am I?265-1:-23:-13,-992 --> -1:-23:-30,-208
I don't know what's going onin your personal life,266-1:-23:-30,-787 --> -1:-23:-51,-636
but it seems to be entering theworkplace. Appearances matter.267-1:-23:-52,-794 --> -1:-24:-14,-222
We can't have an editor lookingmore disheveled than his reporters.268-1:-24:-14,-801 --> -1:-24:-30,-437
Two hours.You'll have something.269-1:-24:-31,-17 --> -1:-24:-42,-599
Did you know JackieSharp's running for whip?270-1:-24:-43,-179 --> -1:-25:-1,-132
- No, it's the first I'm hearing of it.- I spoke to Webb.271-1:-25:-1,-711 --> -1:-25:-24,-876
He got an e-mail from Lorrie Tate aboutme. I got one from Dave Holland about him.272-1:-25:-26,-34 --> -1:-25:-43,-988
- Which means nothing to me.- The junkets, the nepotism.273-1:-25:-44,-567 --> -1:-26:-4,-836
Tate and Sharp are close. Holland serveson the VA Committee with her.274-1:-26:-5,-995 --> -1:-26:-14,-682
She used proxiesto insulate herself.275-1:-26:-15,-840 --> -1:-26:-27,-423
You think she gavethe dirt to them.276-1:-26:-27,-423 --> -1:-26:-41,-321
- She's been playing both of us.- How many commitments you think277-1:-26:-42,-480 --> -1:-26:-55,-221
- she could have?- Around 20 so far.278-1:-26:-55,-800 --> -1:-27:-9,-120
- So she's a distant third.- But she's picking people off us279-1:-27:-9,-699 --> -1:-27:-26,-494
- left and right. I want your help.- You have my support, Wes.280-1:-27:-27,-73 --> -1:-27:-50,-817
- Then make that public. - If I come outfor you, Birch comes out for Webb.281-1:-27:-52,-555 --> -1:-28:-6,-454
- That's gonna hurt you, not help you.- This is serious, Frank.282-1:-28:-6,-454 --> -1:-28:-19,-195
Ted Havemeyeris bankrolling her.283-1:-28:-20,-354 --> -1:-28:-31,-356
- Have you thought of talking to Jackie?- No, no.284-1:-28:-31,-356 --> -1:-28:-47,-573
- I can't do that on principle.- Why not?285-1:-28:-48,-151 --> -1:-29:-5,-525
Anyone who Havemeyer is backing,I don't work with.286-1:-29:-6,-684 --> -1:-29:-18,-267
He pulled this same crap on mewhen I ran for Senate.287-1:-29:-18,-846 --> -1:-29:-32,-745
He financed my primary opponent.Asshole.288-1:-29:-33,-903 --> -1:-29:-48,-381
Well, that is your call.But if you're gonna let an old grudge289-1:-29:-48,-381 --> -1:-30:-1,-122
- get in the way of progress...- I just can't do it, Frank.290-1:-30:-2,-281 --> -1:-30:-16,-759
Havemeyer's been trying to shoveme down the totem pole for years.291-1:-30:-17,-338 --> -1:-30:-28,-342
I won't give himthe satisfaction.292-1:-30:-28,-342 --> -1:-30:-47,-453
Well, I can respect that,but my hands are tied.293-1:-30:-48,-611 --> -1:-31:-8,-881
It's a delicate matter, but we are incommunication with the Chinese government294-1:-31:-10,-39 --> -1:-31:-22,-780
- as to how to move forward.- This mean the US will back down295-1:-31:-23,-359 --> -1:-31:-36,-100
- on cyberattacks?- The United States never backs down,296-1:-31:-37,-259 --> -1:-31:-54,-53
particularly on issuesthat are high priority to us.297-1:-31:-54,-633 --> -1:-32:-19,-535
Madame Secretary, what did youtell the head of the delegation?298-1:-32:-39,-805 --> -1:-32:-50,-808
The delegationoverstepped its bounds.299-1:-32:-51,-387 --> -1:-33:-4,-128
But Cathy couldn't throw herown people under the bus.300-1:-33:-4,-708 --> -1:-33:-19,-186
She should've consultedus first before speaking publicly.301-1:-33:-20,-923 --> -1:-33:-36,-560
The press was on her doorstep andthe president was in another hemisphere.302-1:-33:-37,-139 --> -1:-33:-56,-250
Look, I'm not condoningwhat she did, but she had to do something.303-1:-33:-56,-830 --> -1:-34:-11,-308
She made a gut calland she acted.304-1:-34:-11,-887 --> -1:-34:-20,-574
We have to distanceourselves from this.305-1:-34:-21,-153 --> -1:-34:-33,-314
- When is the president back?- Tomorrow morning.306-1:-34:-33,-894 --> -1:-34:-41,-422
Can we set up a meeting?307-1:-34:-41,-422 --> -1:-34:-51,-268
Cathy needsto publicly apologize.308-1:-34:-51,-847 --> -1:-35:-1,-113
We get her in the roomwith the president?309-1:-35:-1,-692 --> -1:-35:-13,-274
Shouldn't we all beon the same page first?310-1:-35:-13,-854 --> -1:-35:-24,-857
- I'll see what I can do.- Thank you.311-1:-35:-24,-857 --> -1:-35:-38,-756
Now, you asked me a questionbefore I went and got my food312-1:-35:-39,-915 --> -1:-35:-55,-552
- and I've forgotten what...- Mr. Vice President. General McGinnis.313-1:-35:-56,-709 --> -1:-36:-14,-663
Ah. It's a great honor. I hopeyou don't mind, the presidentwishes he could be here.314-1:-36:-15,-242 --> -1:-36:-27,-404
- He's asked me to fill in.- The honor is mine, sir.315-1:-36:-27,-983 --> -1:-36:-50,-569
- And, General, this is my wife Claire.- It's good to see you, Claire.316-1:-36:-51,-148 --> -1:-37:-3,-889
- It's been a long time.- Yes.317-1:-37:-4,-468 --> -1:-37:-20,-105
- Harvard. We were classmates.- Claire didn't say a thing.318-1:-37:-21,-263 --> -1:-37:-47,-324
We dated for a time.Well, about five minutes.319-1:-37:-47,-903 --> -1:-37:-58,-906
Anyway, I'll let youget back to your meal.320-1:-37:-59,-486 --> -1:-38:-12,-806
Thank you. I've remembered.321-1:-38:-14,-543 --> -1:-38:-38,-288
Interestingly enough, in South Carolinam,the largest crop is not cotton.322-1:-38:-38,-867 --> -1:-39:-5,-506
No. It's tobacco.And the third largest crop is marijuana.323-1:-39:-6,-665 --> -1:-39:-17,-89
Now...324-1:-39:-17,-669 --> -1:-39:-29,-831
We'll just keepthat to ourselves.325-1:-39:-29,-831 --> -1:-39:-41,-992
Would you all excuse mefor just a moment?326-1:-39:-49,-521 --> -1:-39:-58,-208
- Is she alone?- Yes.327-1:-39:-58,-787 --> -1:-40:-12,-107
Will you give usa few moments, please.328-1:-40:-41,-643 --> -1:-40:-52,-646
What's wrong?329-1:-41:-3,-71 --> -1:-41:-24,-499
- It was him.- Who?330-1:-41:-37,-240 --> -1:-41:-49,-401
Freshman year.331-1:-42:-4,-458 --> -1:-42:-15,-462
You mean...?332-1:-42:-23,-570 --> -1:-42:-39,-207
McGinnis?333-1:-42:-39,-786 --> -1:-42:-49,-52
Francis. Francis!334-1:-42:-49,-52 --> -1:-43:-5,-268
Please, don't do anything,please!335-1:-43:-6,-426 --> -1:-43:-16,-850
I am not gonna pina medal on that man.336-1:-43:-17,-429 --> -1:-43:-27,-275
- You have to!- Just a minute, please!337-1:-43:-27,-275 --> -1:-43:-39,-437
- There is no way...- They want to start.338-1:-43:-40,-595 --> -1:-43:-52,-177
Just a minute, please!He does not deserve a medal.339-1:-43:-52,-757 --> -1:-44:-8,-393
- That man needs to be taken out and shot!- I am begging you. Please!340-1:-44:-8,-393 --> -1:-44:-30,-400
- No! I said just a minute!- Do not make a scene!341-1:-44:-32,-716 --> -1:-44:-44,-299
Please!342-1:-47:-42,-93 --> -1:-47:-58,-309
Tom.343-1:-47:-59,-467 --> -1:-48:-11,-50
Thanks for coming by.344-1:-48:-30,-740 --> -1:-48:-58,-539
You know, I thought I would missthis place the moment I stepped inside...345-1:-49:-6,-646 --> -1:-49:-18,-229
...but I don't.346-1:-49:-35,-603 --> -1:-49:-46,-606
Hope you like Stella.347-1:-50:-24,-250 --> -1:-50:-38,-149
- Cheers.- Here's how.348-1:-51:-21,-584 --> -1:-51:-45,-329
- How are things?- Ah! They're good.349-1:-51:-55,-174 --> -1:-52:-6,-177
They're good.350-1:-52:-17,-760 --> -1:-52:-37,-451
- You're happy?- I haven't been happy a day in my life.351-1:-52:-38,-609 --> -1:-53:-5,-828
But I have time now.To think. To write.352-1:-53:-6,-407 --> -1:-53:-23,-202
- Been working on a novel.- Yeah?353-1:-53:-24,-360 --> -1:-53:-48,-104
Mm. It's absolute shit,but that's OK.354-1:-53:-48,-684 --> -1:-54:-5,-479
That's great, Tom.That's really great.355-1:-54:-6,-58 --> -1:-54:-30,-960
What's on your mind? I know youdidn't ask me here just to catch up.356-1:-56:-2,-464 --> -1:-56:-13,-467
Frank Underwood.357-1:-56:-14,-46 --> -1:-56:-27,-945
On the president'sbehalf, it is my great honor358-1:-56:-27,-945 --> -1:-56:-40,-687
to formally recognizethe selection359-1:-56:-41,-265 --> -1:-56:-58,-639
of General Alicia Hamptonas commander,360-1:-56:-59,-797 --> -1:-57:-11,-380
United States European Command,361-1:-57:-11,-380 --> -1:-57:-25,-858
and General Dalton McGinnisas commander362-1:-57:-27,-17 --> -1:-57:-40,-916
of the United StatesStrategic Command.363-1:-57:-42,-74 --> -1:-57:-54,-814
The United States Marine Corpshas been well served364-1:-57:-55,-395 --> -1:-58:-23,-192
by these two...exemplary leaders.365-1:-58:-23,-771 --> -1:-58:-43,-462
The president and I are gratefulfor their continued service.366-1:-59:-40,-218 --> -1:-59:-58,-170
- Congratulations.- Thank you, sir.367-2:-3:-46,-928 --> -2:-4:-2,-564
You think I'm insane?368-2:-4:-3,-723 --> -2:-4:-21,-676
I don't think you're insane.369-2:-4:-37,-892 --> -2:-4:-59,-319
I think you've been through a lot.You're trying to make sense of it all.370-2:-5:00,-478 --> -2:-5:-22,-484
- I know I'm right.- I'm sure you believe you are.371-2:-5:-23,-63 --> -2:-5:-36,-384
It's a fact that he helpedcover up the DUI.372-2:-5:-37,-542 --> -2:-6:-7,-77
Imagine if one of your reporterscame to you with this story.373-2:-6:-7,-657 --> -2:-6:-22,-136
- Could you print a word of it?- No, but I'd have them keep digging.374-2:-6:-23,-294 --> -2:-6:-35,-455
Would you? If you'rehonest with yourself,375-2:-6:-36,-34 --> -2:-6:-48,-775
wouldn't you tell them itseemed far-fetched?376-2:-6:-48,-775 --> -2:-7:-6,-729
Your notes aren't convincing.The police reports don't prove a link.377-2:-7:-7,-887 --> -2:-7:-24,-682
- And the speculative leaps you're making?- I know.378-2:-7:-25,-261 --> -2:-7:-50,-163
Hold yourself to the samestandards you hold your staff.379-2:-8:-15,-66 --> -2:-8:-24,-332
You and Zoewere seeing each other.380-2:-8:-33,-20 --> -2:-8:-47,-498
I'm assuming. Maybe I'm wrong.381-2:-9:-12,-979 --> -2:-9:-24,-562
No, we were.382-2:-10:-21,-895 --> -2:-10:-41,-08
When I lost my first wife,it didn't add up.383-2:-10:-41,-586 --> -2:-11:00,-698
Who dies of breast cancer at 31?384-2:-11:-1,-277 --> -2:-11:-29,-654
I wanted to sue, doctors,the hospital, everyone.385-2:-11:-30,-812 --> -2:-11:-45,-870
I thought they werehiding something.386-2:-11:-55,-137 --> -2:-12:-5,-561
No.387-2:-12:-6,-140 --> -2:-12:-33,-359
Grief demands an answer,but sometimes there isn't one.388-2:-12:-43,-204 --> -2:-13:-12,-740
Her life couldn't be saved.Period.389-2:-13:-20,-848 --> -2:-13:-30,-693
What do I do?390-2:-13:-39,-960 --> -2:-13:-53,-279
Would you considerseeing someone?391-2:-13:-53,-858 --> -2:-14:-7,-758
There's a therapist who helpedme when Cynthia passed away.392-2:-14:-7,-758 --> -2:-14:-20,-499
- I can put you in touch with...- No, I don't need to see somebody.393-2:-14:-21,-78 --> -2:-14:-44,-822
- Lucas.- I appreciate you coming by, Tom.394-2:-14:-53,-509 --> -2:-15:-5,-92
Thanks for the beer.395-2:-15:-19,-570 --> -2:-15:-28,-836
You can call me anytime.396-2:-16:-18,-62 --> -2:-16:-32,-541
You take care of yourself,Lucas.397-2:-16:-47,-19 --> -2:-16:-57,-444
I mean it.398-2:-18:-5,-203 --> -2:-18:-18,-523
Any plans to go elsewhere, sir?399-2:-18:-19,-680 --> -2:-18:-30,-105
No, we're infor the night. Thank you.400-2:-18:-30,-684 --> -2:-18:-40,-530
Yes, sir.401-2:-19:-14,-119 --> -2:-19:-23,-964
Hey.402-2:-19:-41,-917 --> -2:-19:-53,-500
I'm tired.403-2:-24:-39,-12 --> -2:-24:-52,-333
Do you need something, sir?404-2:-24:-52,-912 --> -2:-25:-14,-340
My remote, I wanna play.405-2:-25:-15,-498 --> -2:-25:-28,-239
It's right over here.406-2:-25:-43,-296 --> -2:-25:-53,-720
Thank you.407-2:-26:-33,-681 --> -2:-26:-46,-421
Something wrong with theInternet? I can't get online.408-2:-26:-46,-421 --> -2:-27:-7,-271
We had to disable the access.It's not a secure connection.409-2:-29:00,-202 --> -2:-29:-11,-785
Would you justgive me a moment, please?410-2:-29:-11,-785 --> -2:-29:-33,-211
Whenever you're out here,somebody needs to be with you.411-2:-29:-34,-370 --> -2:-29:-52,-903
I can't be alonein my own backyard?412-2:-29:-54,-60 --> -2:-30:-14,-331
If it were up to me, sir,but it's not up to me.413-2:-30:-48,-500 --> -2:-31:-1,-820
OK, Meechum.414-2:-35:-8,-530 --> -2:-35:-21,-270
You think I don'twant to smash things?415-2:-35:-32,-853 --> -2:-35:-56,-18
I know what that anger ismore than you can imagine.416-2:-36:-15,-130 --> -2:-36:-31,-925
- When he was on top of me...- - We don't have to talk about it.417-2:-36:-32,-503 --> -2:-36:-45,-245
No, I want to.418-2:-37:-4,-356 --> -2:-37:-24,-625
When he was on top of me,I pressed my hand...419-2:-37:-42,000 --> -2:-38:-12,-115
...with everything I could,I pressed it into his face.420-2:-38:-13,-852 --> -2:-38:-34,-122
I pressed it so hard,I broke his nose.421-2:-38:-39,-334 --> -2:-38:-53,-233
That didn't stop him.422-2:-39:-6,-553 --> -2:-39:-31,-456
He shoved the sheets in mymouth. I could barely breathe.423-2:-40:-8,-520 --> -2:-40:-37,-476
Every time I think of her,pinned down like that,424-2:-40:-39,-214 --> -2:-41:-12,-804
I strangle her, Francis...so she doesn't strangle me.425-2:-41:-24,-387 --> -2:-41:-38,-865
I have to.426-2:-41:-39,-444 --> -2:-41:-51,-27
We have to.427-2:-42:-7,-242 --> -2:-42:-21,-141
The alternative is...428-2:-42:-29,-250 --> -2:-42:-41,-990
...it's unlivable.429-2:-43:-10,-947 --> -2:-43:-24,-267
You should go to sleep.430-2:-43:-46,-274 --> -2:-44:-4,-227
I'm not sure if I can.431-2:-44:-4,-806 --> -2:-44:-22,-180
Then you shouldgo back downstairs.432-2:-45:-57,-158 --> -2:-46:-15,-111
You'll still feelthe hate in the morning.433-2:-46:-21,-481 --> -2:-46:-33,-643
You'll use that.434-2:-46:-34,-223 --> -2:-46:-48,-701
But not on him.435-2:-47:-50,-667 --> -2:-48:-8,-41
<i>What did you</i><i>communicate, exactly?</i>436-2:-48:-8,-621 --> -2:-48:-30,-49
I told him to bring up the agenda,suggest bullet points for the SED,437-2:-48:-31,-208 --> -2:-48:-54,-373
- but make no demands. - And how did thattranslate into a direct ultimatum?438-2:-48:-55,-531 --> -2:-49:-15,-800
Well, sometimes my delegatestry to read between the lines.439-2:-49:-16,-958 --> -2:-49:-36,-70
They know that I need plausibledeniability for diplomatic purposes.440-2:-49:-36,-649 --> -2:-49:-44,-177
Why didn't youimmediately recant?441-2:-49:-44,-177 --> -2:-49:-54,-23
In my experience withthe Chinese,442-2:-49:-54,-602 --> -2:-50:-9,-660
backpedaling makes uslook weak. I had two choices:443-2:-50:-10,-239 --> -2:-50:-35,-720
lose face or exhibit strength.I chose the latter.444-2:-50:-36,-878 --> -2:-50:-57,-148
- All right, I'll be in touch shortly.- Thank you, sir.445-2:-51:-45,-795 --> -2:-52:00,-853
Get me Raymondon the private line.446-2:-52:-22,-281 --> -2:-52:-38,-497
- Think she overstepped on purpose?- Cathy would never disobey.447-2:-52:-39,-655 --> -2:-52:-58,-187
- Not on purpose.- Raymond, I've got Frank here.448-2:-52:-58,-766 --> -2:-53:-18,-457
<i>- Just the three of us?</i>- Just us three. Morning, Raymond.449-2:-53:-19,-616 --> -2:-53:-46,-255
My contacts in Beijing tell methe minister of commerce is in a tizzy.450-2:-53:-46,-834 --> -2:-54:-5,-946
<i>Wants to use this as an excuse</i><i>to start clenching fists.</i>451-2:-54:-7,-104 --> -2:-54:-20,-424
Either I turn my back on Cathyor I stand behind her.452-2:-54:-21,-03 --> -2:-54:-38,-377
<i>- It's got to be the former.</i>- I agree. If you don't apologize,453-2:-54:-38,-957 --> -2:-54:-55,-172
<i>you go from ruffling feathers</i><i>to plucking them.</i>454-2:-54:-56,-331 --> -2:-55:-9,-71
And the Chinese won'tstand for that, Mr. President.455-2:-55:-9,-71 --> -2:-55:-22,-391
What about perceived miscommunicationbetween me and my Cabinet?456-2:-55:-22,-970 --> -2:-55:-40,-344
<i>Mr. President, right nowthe goal is to resume the talks.</i>457-2:-55:-41,-502 --> -2:-55:-52,-505
I wouldn't worryabout perceptions.458-2:-55:-53,-85 --> -2:-56:-2,-351
<i>Frank is right.</i><i>We need to be pragmatic.</i>459-2:-56:-2,-351 --> -2:-56:-13,-934
Worry about appearances later.460-2:-56:-35,-362 --> -2:-56:-48,-682
All right, I'll have Catherinedraft an apology.461-2:-56:-48,-682 --> -2:-57:-3,-161
No, it has to comefrom you, Mr. President.462-2:-57:-3,-740 --> -2:-57:-19,-956
If the apology is to mean anything,it must come from the White House.463-2:-57:-21,-692 --> -2:-57:-36,-750
That is certainlythe more likely to succeed.464-2:-57:-56,-440 --> -2:-58:-4,-548
Fine. I'll do it, then.465-2:-58:-5,-127 --> -2:-58:-21,-922
<i>- Thank you, Raymond.</i>- Thank you, Garrett.466-2:-58:-32,-926 --> -2:-58:-52,-617
Do you hear how he stilluses the President's given name?467-2:-58:-53,-775 --> -2:-59:-19,-255
And that Walker doesn't flinchat the lack of respect it implies?468-2:-59:-35,-472 --> -2:-59:-59,-795
Sir, forgive me if this isn'tthe case, but you seem a bit hesitant.469-3:00:-1,-533 --> -3:00:-17,-169
- Why do you say that?- Well, you've raised a good point470-3:00:-17,-749 --> -3:00:-31,-69
about public perception.I don't want you to think471-3:00:-31,-647 --> -3:00:-54,-813
- that I'm dismissing your concernscasually. - It's a concern for you, too?472-3:00:-55,-972 --> -3:-1:-27,-245
- There is some insight into what Cathybrought up. - Backpedaling as weakness.473-3:-1:-41,-143 --> -3:-1:-56,-202
Well, it's always a coin tosswith the Chinese.474-3:-1:-56,-781 --> -3:-2:-23,-420
But sometimes, standing yourground is better than giving in.475-3:-2:-24,-579 --> -3:-2:-43,-112
They respect you morewhen you show strength.476-3:-2:-43,-690 --> -3:-3:-1,-643
Are you changingyour mind on this, Frank?477-3:-3:-2,-801 --> -3:-3:-27,-705
I just think it's importantthat you do what you think is best.478-3:-3:-28,-863 --> -3:-3:-56,-82
The American people voted youpresident, not me, not Raymond Tusk.479-3:-4:-8,-244 --> -3:-4:-25,-38
- I'll let you know what I decide.- Thank you, sir.480-3:-4:-55,-732 --> -3:-5:-11,-949
You think she'sUnderwood's choice?481-3:-5:-12,-527 --> -3:-5:-24,-689
He deflected, so it's possible.482-3:-6:-4,-70 --> -3:-6:-28,-393
You and I, we needto work together on this, Wes.483-3:-6:-29,-551 --> -3:-6:-46,-347
- Before we both get screwed.- I agree.484-3:-7:-4,-879 --> -3:-7:-29,-782
One of us drops out,throws support to the other.485-3:-7:-30,-361 --> -3:-7:-44,-838
That'll dwarfany following she has.486-3:-7:-45,-997 --> -3:-8:-3,-951
You want me to drop out.487-3:-8:-4,-530 --> -3:-8:-17,-271
I'll make sure you get mychairmanship on Appropriations.488-3:-8:-39,-278 --> -3:-9:-1,-864
All you can offer me is Ethics,which nobody wants.489-3:-9:-23,-291 --> -3:-9:-37,-191
Let's put this to bed, Wes.490-3:-9:-56,-881 --> -3:-10:-7,-306
Webb must haveoffered him a deal.491-3:-10:-7,-306 --> -3:-10:-15,-414
Then we haveto offer a better one.492-3:-10:-16,-571 --> -3:-10:-25,-258
I'm guessing Appropriations.493-3:-10:-25,-258 --> -3:-10:-32,-788
There's no way I can top that.494-3:-10:-33,-367 --> -3:-10:-42,-632
Except for Ways and Means.495-3:-11:00,-585 --> -3:-11:-16,-802
I won't let you give your chairto an ass like Buchwalter.496-3:-11:-17,-380 --> -3:-11:-33,-18
If you're the whip, you outrankhim and every other chairman.497-3:-11:-33,-596 --> -3:-11:-50,-970
Screw committees. I'll have adirect line to the Speaker.498-3:-11:-52,-128 --> -3:-12:-14,-135
- Don't be stubborn, Jackie.- You think he'd take it?499-3:-12:-14,-715 --> -3:-12:-24,-560
He was willingto take a deal from Webb.500-3:-12:-24,-560 --> -3:-12:-39,-39
You're the only personhe hates more.501-3:-12:-40,-196 --> -3:-13:-3,-941
He's a brute,but he's not an idiot.502-3:-13:-50,-272 --> -3:-14:-3,-12
Well, I know you're notrefusing out of loyalty.503-3:-14:-3,-592 --> -3:-14:-27,-335
- True.- So it's because of Ted.504-3:-14:-48,-185 --> -3:-15:-6,-137
You think you are hot shit,don't you?505-3:-15:-7,-296 --> -3:-15:-33,-358
Can we set egos aside andtalk business like the adults we are?506-3:-15:-47,-256 --> -3:-16:-5,-210
- I want more than Ways and Means.- Tell me.507-3:-16:-6,-368 --> -3:-16:-28,-954
I want Havemeyer gone.Not just retired...508-3:-16:-57,-911 --> -3:-17:-10,-73
...politically dead.509-3:-17:-10,-73 --> -3:-17:-22,-234
That race was 12 years ago.510-3:-17:-22,-813 --> -3:-17:-37,-291
That was 12 yearsI could've been in the Senate.511-3:-17:-38,-450 --> -3:-18:-5,-668
Revenge? Really?512-3:-18:-6,-249 --> -3:-18:-19,-569
Not revenge.513-3:-18:-28,-833 --> -3:-18:-39,-258
Equity.514-3:-18:-49,-103 --> -3:-19:-9,-373
- Well, what are you gonna do?- Buchwalter won't budge.515-3:-19:-10,-533 --> -3:-19:-34,-276
You know, there's nothingI despise more in life than pettiness.516-3:-19:-35,-434 --> -3:-19:-52,-230
I could approach Webb,but I don't have enough to offer him.517-3:-19:-52,-808 --> -3:-20:-11,-919
He'd never drop out.Too much pride.518-3:-20:-13,-78 --> -3:-20:-32,-769
- I'm not sure what to do.- This is my file on Ted.519-3:-20:-33,-347 --> -3:-20:-50,-143
An illegitimate daughter.The nanny, of course.520-3:-20:-50,-721 --> -3:-21:-12,-150
Her name is Emily Rodriguez.Nineteen, cerebral palsy.521-3:-21:-13,-308 --> -3:-21:-25,-469
I know about Emily.522-3:-21:-41,-685 --> -3:-21:-57,-901
- Why are we having this conversation?- It's complicated.523-3:-21:-58,-481 --> -3:-22:-16,-433
The daughter? It's veryblack-and-white to me.524-3:-22:-17,-13 --> -3:-22:-41,-336
I've known Ted since I was born.He and my father were very close.525-3:-22:-42,-494 --> -3:-22:-59,-290
- Yeah, I'm aware.- He's always looked out for me.526-3:-22:-59,-868 --> -3:-23:-14,-926
He got me into West Point.He funded my first race.527-3:-23:-16,-84 --> -3:-23:-28,-247
I like Ted. He's alwaysbeen a team player.528-3:-23:-28,-247 --> -3:-23:-42,-725
- It's unfortunate he has this secret.- It was a mistake.529-3:-23:-43,-303 --> -3:-23:-56,-624
One he's always regretted.After she was born,530-3:-23:-57,-782 --> -3:-24:-12,-839
he asked me to check in on herbecause he couldn't.531-3:-24:-13,-417 --> -3:-24:-42,-375
- Because he trusted me.- I see.532-3:-24:-42,-954 --> -3:-25:00,-908
You came in here knowingwhat you had to do,533-3:-25:-2,-66 --> -3:-25:-17,-702
hoping I would pull a rabbitout of a hat so you wouldn't have to.534-3:-25:-18,-282 --> -3:-25:-46,-659
I know the girl. I know her mother.These people don't deserve this.535-3:-25:-48,-396 --> -3:-26:-5,-770
I've given you all I can.Whatever you decide is your prerogative.536-3:-26:-6,-348 --> -3:-26:-32,-410
- But maybe I misjudged you.- Ted is family to me.537-3:-26:-34,-147 --> -3:-26:-54,-997
An adopted daughter,in lieu of a real one.538-3:-26:-55,-575 --> -3:-27:-11,-791
- Sir, the secretary is here.- Thank you. Send her in.539-3:-27:-12,-949 --> -3:-27:-26,-269
Excuse us.540-3:-28:-26,-500 --> -3:-28:-36,-922
- It's good.- Not too long?541-3:-28:-37,-502 --> -3:-28:-50,-243
A little bit, but not much.542-3:-28:-50,-823 --> -3:-29:-15,-146
- This part, three paragraphs in.- About the phone companies?543-3:-29:-16,-304 --> -3:-29:-34,-836
- Tell me more. - It's one ofHomeland Security's major concerns.544-3:-29:-35,-416 --> -3:-29:-50,-474
That the cyberattacks mightinfiltrate phone carriers,545-3:-29:-51,-52 --> -3:-30:-3,-792
get access to millionsof people's data history.546-3:-30:-4,-373 --> -3:-30:-17,-693
- Like who they called?- Yeah. Who they called, texted,547-3:-30:-18,-271 --> -3:-30:-35,-645
what they texted, when,where they were. Everything.548-3:-30:-36,-804 --> -3:-30:-59,-390
- And that's possible? - There haven't beenany catastrophic breaches yet.549-3:-30:-59,-969 --> -3:-31:-14,-448
At least not reported.But it looks like the Chinese are starting550-3:-31:-15,-606 --> -3:-31:-30,-663
to recruit mercenaries on the Deep Webto launch guerilla-type attacks551-3:-31:-30,-663 --> -3:-31:-44,-563
- that can't be traced back...- Hold on. The "Deep Web."552-3:-31:-45,-141 --> -3:-32:00,-779
- I've heard of that.- Yeah, no, 96 percent of the Internet553-3:-32:-1,-357 --> -3:-32:-18,-153
isn't accessible through standardsearch engines. Most of it's useless.554-3:-32:-19,-310 --> -3:-32:-36,-105
But it's where you go to findanything and everything:555-3:-32:-36,-684 --> -3:-33:-1,-07
child porn, bitcoin laundering,mail-order narcotics, hackers for hire.556-3:-33:-2,-166 --> -3:-33:-16,-644
- How do you access it?- It's actually pretty easy.557-3:-33:-17,-224 --> -3:-33:-31,-123
- I could show you if you want.- Yeah, I'm curious.558-3:-33:-31,-123 --> -3:-33:-42,-705
- Mind if I...?- Go ahead.559-3:-33:-43,-863 --> -3:-33:-54,-288
First thing you need's Tor.560-3:-33:-54,-868 --> -3:-34:-13,-399
Some people prefer I2P,but I think Tor is better.561-3:-34:-13,-979 --> -3:-34:-41,-776
- What is Tor? - Protects you throughproxy servers, keeps you anonymous.562-3:-34:-42,-936 --> -3:-34:-56,-254
Then I'll show how to getto the posting boards and the IRCs.563-3:-34:-56,-834 --> -3:-35:-28,-687
But I gotta warn you, be carefulwhat you click. Some crazy shit there, man.564-3:-35:-29,-844 --> -3:-35:-52,-431
For too long,we've danced on eggshells565-3:-35:-53,-589 --> -3:-36:-10,-384
regarding the issueof cyberwarfare.566-3:-36:-10,-963 --> -3:-36:-46,-290
<i>Secretary Durant acted on instructions</i><i>that came directly from me.</i>567-3:-36:-47,-449 --> -3:-37:-4,-823
<i>Now, if the Chinese are not willingto engage in a meaningful dialogue</i>568-3:-37:-5,-981 --> -3:-37:-20,-459
<i>about intellectual property</i><i>of American corporations,</i>569-3:-37:-21,-38 --> -3:-37:-45,-941
<i>as well as this deliberate targeting ofour government's online infrastructure,</i>570-3:-37:-47,-99 --> -3:-38:-2,-737
<i>well, then that is proof</i><i>of a double-standard mentality</i>571-3:-38:-3,-315 --> -3:-38:-14,-897
<i>that we shall</i><i>no longer tolerate.</i>572-3:-38:-15,-477 --> -3:-38:-36,-905
<i>Our delegation to the Joint Commission</i><i>on Commerce and Trade</i>573-3:-38:-38,-63 --> -3:-38:-57,-174
<i>was unfairly accused and defamed</i>574-3:-38:-57,-754 --> -3:-39:-19,-760
<i>by representatives of the</i><i>United States government.</i>575-3:-39:-20,-919 --> -3:-39:-31,-922
<i>The People's Republic of China</i>576-3:-39:-32,-501 --> -3:-40:-3,-195
<i>will not be threatened byderisive and unsubstantiated claims.</i>577-3:-40:-3,-775 --> -3:-40:-26,-360
<i>As long as the White House</i><i>continues to behave this way,</i>578-3:-40:-27,-519 --> -3:-40:-55,-896
<i>any future bilateral trade</i><i>talks will be impossible.</i>579-3:-40:-57,-634 --> -3:-41:-8,-59
It caught me by surprise, too.580-3:-41:-8,-59 --> -3:-41:-24,-853
Did you say anything to himafter I hung up yesterday?581-3:-41:-25,-433 --> -3:-41:-43,-385
- No. Have you spoken to him?- <i> A few minutes ago.</i>582-3:-41:-44,-543 --> -3:-41:-57,-285
He said he didwhat he thought was right.583-3:-41:-57,-864 --> -3:-42:-10,-604
<i>Well, there's nothing</i><i>we can do to combat that.</i>584-3:-42:-10,-604 --> -3:-42:-33,-191
He doesn't usually go againstmy advice without giving me fair warning.585-3:-42:-34,-928 --> -3:-43:-2,-148
- What are you suggesting, Raymond?- He's easily manipulated.586-3:-43:-2,-726 --> -3:-43:-18,-942
- Clearly, not in this case.- <i> We need to fix this.</i>587-3:-43:-19,-522 --> -3:-43:-38,-633
<i>- And I'm counting on you for that, Frank.</i>- Let me freshen your memory.588-3:-43:-39,-791 --> -3:-44:-3,-535
<i>I don't owe you any favors.</i><i>I promised to work with you, not for you.</i>589-3:-44:-4,-115 --> -3:-44:-16,-855
And when it comes to China,we both want the same thing.590-3:-44:-18,-13 --> -3:-44:-37,-705
- So we need to work together.<i>- To convince Garrett he should retract.</i>591-3:-44:-38,-283 --> -3:-44:-51,-25
To support the presidentin the path that he's chosen.592-3:-44:-51,-25 --> -3:-45:-6,-82
While he continuesto antagonize them publicly.593-3:-45:-7,-240 --> -3:-45:-23,-456
While he continues to benefitfrom a bump in approval ratings.594-3:-45:-24,-35 --> -3:-45:-48,-938
<i>A tough stance on China is popular,and we can use that to our advantage.</i>595-3:-45:-50,-674 --> -3:-46:-8,-48
<i>Let's just be patient and see if we cansmooth things over from back channels.</i>596-3:-46:-8,-628 --> -3:-46:-24,-264
If I don't see any results,you won't have my patience for long.597-3:-46:-24,-844 --> -3:-46:-52,-63
- That's understood.- Let me know what Durant has to say.598-3:-46:-53,-800 --> -3:-47:-12,-333
- Absolutely.- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.599-3:-47:-30,-865 --> -3:-47:-53,-452
I thought he might balkat taking a handout from me.600-3:-47:-54,-610 --> -3:-48:-5,-34
I'd call it more than a handout.601-3:-48:-5,-34 --> -3:-48:-32,-253
Well, he's always been the sort of manwho could be bought,602-3:-48:-33,-991 --> -3:-48:-47,-310
but never cheaply.603-3:-48:-47,-310 --> -3:-49:-8,-159
It's not the chairmanshipthat bought him, Ted.604-3:-49:-9,-317 --> -3:-49:-20,-900
What do you mean?605-3:-49:-21,-479 --> -3:-49:-40,-11
I'm telling you this so thatyou have time to call your wife606-3:-49:-40,-591 --> -3:-49:-52,-751
and prepare your statement.607-3:-50:-36,-187 --> -3:-50:-53,-561
What's my out?What's he want from me?608-3:-50:-54,-719 --> -3:-51:-9,-777
There is no out.He wants it to hurt.609-3:-51:-23,-97 --> -3:-51:-34,-680
- You told him?- I just promised him610-3:-51:-35,-837 --> -3:-51:-55,-528
- that I could make it happen.- You can't do this, Jackie.611-3:-51:-56,-107 --> -3:-52:-12,-902
The story's breaking tomorrow.612-3:-52:-13,-481 --> -3:-52:-35,-489
- What part of it?- No names. Just that you have a daughter.613-3:-52:-36,-647 --> -3:-52:-56,-336
Have you thought aboutwhat this will do to Diane?614-3:-52:-56,-916 --> -3:-53:-19,-501
- To our sons?- I hate myself for it.615-3:-53:-20,-662 --> -3:-53:-38,-614
- But I'll get over that.- What about her?616-3:-53:-39,-193 --> -3:-54:-2,-359
- Emily? You can't even sayher name, can you? - Don't lecture me.617-3:-54:-3,-516 --> -3:-54:-12,-204
You've never beenin the same room with her.618-3:-54:-12,-784 --> -3:-54:-26,-682
She's had the besttreatment available.619-3:-54:-26,-682 --> -3:-54:-38,-264
Alone. Hooked upto machines.620-3:-54:-38,-844 --> -3:-54:-52,-743
Surrounded by nurseswho punch out at dinnertime.621-3:-54:-53,-901 --> -3:-55:-9,-537
- You don't know what I've been through.- You? What about her?622-3:-55:-9,-537 --> -3:-55:-32,-703
- I can't do more than I've done.- That's bullshit, Ted.623-3:-55:-34,-440 --> -3:-55:-48,-918
- You could've found a way.- I won't defend myself to you.624-3:-55:-48,-918 --> -3:-56:-3,-976
Don't. Save thatfor your wife.625-3:-56:-29,-458 --> -3:-56:-47,-412
This isn't to punish you, Ted.It's simpler than that.626-3:-56:-47,-990 --> -3:-56:-59,-572
When I first encouragedyou to run for office,627-3:-57:00,-152 --> -3:-57:-21,-580
it's because I sensedhow unstoppable you were.628-3:-57:-22,-738 --> -3:-57:-54,-590
But I never thought I'd haveto lie down on the tracks myself.629-3:-58:-3,-857 --> -3:-58:-23,-546
If you're going to putmy neck in the noose,630-3:-58:-24,-126 --> -3:-58:-47,-872
look me in the eyewhile you do it.631-3:-59:-37,-97 --> -3:-59:-56,-788
I'm very gratefulfor all that you've done for me.632-3:-59:-57,-367 --> -4:00:-13,-582
You'll make an excellentwhip, Jacqueline.633-4:00:-14,-162 --> -4:00:-31,-536
Now, pleaseget out of my office.634-4:-2:-1,-301 --> -4:-2:-14,-622
What are you doing?635-4:-2:-21,-571 --> -4:-2:-34,-311
Sh, sh, sh, sh!636-4:-3:-17,-746 --> -4:-3:-38,-16
It's finally quiet.637-4:-3:-53,-652 --> -4:-4:-15,-660
It is, isn't it?638-4:-4:-16,-239 --> -4:-4:-37,-86
We have our fortress now.639-4:-4:-38,-247 --> -4:-4:-56,-778
- Where are you coming from?- My new office.640-4:-4:-57,-357 --> -4:-5:-11,-256
You just finishedsetting it up today.641-4:-5:-12,-415 --> -4:-5:-33,-842
- Do you like it?- It's an office. It's fine.642-4:-9:-58,-505 --> -4:-10:-15,-879
